# server_browser
A mini server and command line browser that can send and reply with basic http GET and POST requests

A simple web server that receives requests and sends a response based on those requests. The command line browser can issue either a GET or POST http request.

a) GET request: the server will reply with a small html page

b) POST request: you will be asked to enter a name and email. These will be sent to the server, who will add them into an html document and will send the modified html document to the browser.
